<h2 align='left'> Project Description</h2><br />
<p font-family: MyCustomMonoFont, monospace>You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their <b>employees</b> and <b>log_in_attempts</b> tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.</p> <br/>

<h2 align='left' >Retrieve after hours failed login attempts</h2><br />
<p>To investigate this, you need to query the <b>log_in_attempts</b> table and review after hours login activity. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. (The time of the login attempt is found in the <b>login_time column</b>. The <b>success</b> column contains a value of <b>0</b> when a login attempt failed; you can use either a value of <b>0</b> or <b>FALSE</b> in your query to identify failed login attempts.)
